### Introduction 
Hello, my name is Quentin Sturner. In this project, I will be extending a database (initially designed by "Team Mavericks") to include a rating system for both drivers and restuarants. The original database outlines a campus food-delivery system designed specifically the University of North Carolina at Charlotte that operates similarly to existing services like GrubHub™ or UberEats™. See **Business Rules** for more details.
